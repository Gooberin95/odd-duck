### Odd duck lab
## This app will allow voting on images of products for a set amount of rounds. This was to help a company do some polling on which product they should go with. We made sure to implement local storage when intaking the data of votes so that we could render it in a chart to show the user or company when they wanted to see the total number of votes products have been getting.
